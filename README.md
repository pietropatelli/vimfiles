- To use python, vim needs to be compiled with the appropriate option
- In Windows, the installed python and vim must both be 32 or 64 bit
- To use gvim in fullscreen in Windows, see [gvimfullscreen_win32](https://github.com/derekmcloughlin/gvimfullscreen_win32/tree/master)
- To map Caps Lock to Escape in Windows, see [uncap](https://github.com/susam/uncap)
- For a useful Italian keyboard layout in Windows, see [ITA_PP](https://github.com/pietropatelli/ITA_PP)
- If powerline separator characters do not render, make sure you have an appropriate [font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master) installed
